### How does it work?
Riot uses a few different methods to make a cohesive game. XMPP is the protocol used for chatting, and it is possible to connect to this server along without the client! 

### Installation

You can find LeagueChat on the Play Store! Sorry iPhone users, but I do not have an iPhone nor a $100 Apple-developers license. 

### Version
0.91

### Resources Used

This project would not be anywhere near what it is without support from the following: 
* [StackOverflow] - Every programmer's best friend.
* [AndroidDev] - Great android development community.
* [TheHolyWaffle] - Many wrappers that makes connecting much easier.
* [Riot] - League of Legends. You know why we're here.
* [Smack] - Java Library used by THW which allows XMPP connection to be possible. Flow is a very patient and great developer.
* Stibbs - Somehow manages to put up with me, but consistently available for feedback and forced testing. <3 


**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**

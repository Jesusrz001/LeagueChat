# LeagueChat
Welcome! LeagueChat is a simple app that lets you chat with your friends from League of Legends from your phone. Features some basic stat-tracking to see how your friends have been holding up on the rift.

### How does it work?
Riot uses a few different methods to make a cohesive game. XMPP is the protocol used for chatting, and it is possible to connect to this server along without the client! 

### Why do I need your password?
I truly wish I didn't. Your login information for the XMPP server on Riot's end (what allows the loading of your friends list, messaging, etc) is the same as your account information. I will make a short Youtube video which will explain where in the code your information is used: it is needed for the login alone, and it is afterwords discarded and all traces cleared from your phone's memory.

### Installation
You can find LeagueChat on the Play Store! Sorry iPhone users, but I do not have an iPhone nor a $100 Apple-developers license. 

### To-Do:
- ~~Use your pre-existing friend groups for organization.~~ [x] Implemented!
- Small bugs with notification not disappearing after seeing the message.
- Make the chatpage look prettier.
- Allow user to set profile icon and status.
- Custom color themes.

### Resources Used
This project would not be anywhere near what it is without support from the following: 
* [StackOverflow] - Every programmer's best friend.
* [AndroidDev] - Great android development community.
* [TheHolyWaffle] - Many wrappers that makes connecting much easier.
* [Riot] - League of Legends. You know why we're here.
* [Smack] - Java Library used by THW which allows XMPP connection to be possible. Flow is a very patient and great developer.
* Stibbs - Somehow manages to put up with me, but consistently available for feedback and forced testing. <3
